# Minimal ATtinyXX17 Board

Barebone ATtiny*XX*17 breakout/development board for the ATtiny417, ATtiny817, ATtiny1617, and ATtiny3217 chips in QFN-24 packaging. All it does is:

- Supply 5V over mini-USB *(if desired, power can also be supplied through edge headers)*
- Provide decoupling capacitors for the chip's supply rail
- Breakout all pins to breadboard-friendly headers
- Provide a standard six-pin AVR-UPDI header

- [ ] Add a power LED
- [ ] Add ATtiny-controlled LED(s)

## Software Used

The board files were originally designed in KiCad 6 and ported forward to KiCad 7.0.10.
